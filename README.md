# SkyEyes
SkyEyes helps our customers to monitor customized scenarios/events with their webcam and sensors on the IoT devices. 

People always look for better ways to protects their house and properties. For example, you may have already had installed some smoke detectors in your place. However, there are sometimes false alarms which may bother you, or maybe you want those IoT devices can react the events in a smarter way. In this project, we will build a smart surveillance platform with sensors, Azure IoT services, Cognitive Services and Bot AI to a provider better solution to reduce the false alarms from the sensors on the devices also provides better interaction ways to interact with users. More over, we will use OpenCV on edge to reduce the communication cost with is one of the most concerns of our customers.

We are still working on it. Please refer to SkyEyes_Intro.mp4 for our idea.
